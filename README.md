# Calculus-Graph-Plotter
A simple C++ program that can plot and graph mathematical equations/functions in 2d
Currently it only supports a single variable function the plan is to add multivariable functions into the mix alsong with support for integration and derivation 
Also plans for piecewise functions too and a 3d mode for working in thhe 3d Plane for more complex equations
